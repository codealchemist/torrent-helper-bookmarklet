# torrent-helper-bookmarklet
Bookmarklet for easy torrent link selection. 
Presents a basic UI to filter and select all torrent links found on a page.

### Current version status
Presents basic UI, allows to filter and easily copy clicked torrent links to clipboard.
Currently working for magnet links only.
Doesn't load full UI when loaded more than once.

### TODO
- Close button should hide everything but a small _show_ button, so the UI can be opened again.
- Filter torrent URLs.
- Find a way to get a link name from a torrent.
- Restyling.

### Testing
Minimize [torrent-helper.bookmarklet.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codealchemist/torrent-helper-bookmarklet/master/torrent-helper.bookmarklet.js) using this tool:
