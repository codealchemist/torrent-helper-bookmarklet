# torrent-helper-bookmarklet
Bookmarklet for easy torrent link selection. 
Presents a basic UI to filter and select all torrent links found on a page.

### Current version status
Presents basic UI, allows to filter and easily copy clicked torrent links to clipboard.
Currently working for magnet links only.
Doesn't load full UI when loaded more than once.

### TODO
- Close button should hide everything but a small _show_ button, so the UI can be opened again.
- Filter torrent URLs.
- Find a way to get a link name from a torrent.
- Restyling.

### How it works?
Bookmarklets are browser bookmarks that execute code.
You can easily install bookmarklets by dragging and dropping bookmarklet links to your bookmarks bar.
You use them by just clicking the bookmark.
